Mark Shephard, @gahansen, @mperego, Vijay Mahadevan, and I, presented
[FASTMath](http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/)
Unstructured Mesh Technologies at this year's Argonne Training Program
on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC).  Along with the talk we prepared a hands-on 
demonstation of an adaptive workflow for 
[simulating Greenland ice-sheet flow](https://github.com/gahansen/Albany/wiki/PAALS-Tutorial-2016). 

In addition to the FASTMath talks and [panels discussion](https://youtu.be/p3mMAuOJ3fU)
there were great presentations on 
[MPI](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/speakers/bill-gropp-uiuc/),
[Knights Landing architecture](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/sessions/presentation-blue-geneq-and-knights-landing-many-core-architectures/),
and a few talks from
[James Reinders](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/speakers/james-reinders-intel/).
