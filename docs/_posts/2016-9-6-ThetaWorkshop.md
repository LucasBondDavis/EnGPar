title: ALCF Theta Workshop
---

@KennethEJansen and I spent a week at the Argonne Leadership Computing
Facilties (ALCF) Theta Workshop learning about Knights Landing, the Intel and Cray
tools, and running performance and scaling studies.  Thanks to the ALCF, Intel,
and Cray staff we were able to run PHASTA on over 3Ki nodes on meshes
balanced with our tools.

For more info on PHASTA visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PHASTA/).
