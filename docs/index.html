  What is EnGPar?
</h3>

<p>
Massively parallel computing combined with scalable simulation workflows that
can reliably model systems of interest are central to the continued quest of
scientists, engineers, and other practitioners to address advances in
scientific discovery, engineering design, and medical treatment.
However, to meet their potential, these methods must be able to operate
efficiently and scale on massively parallel computers executing millions of
processes.
</p>

<p>
EnGPar will provide scalable partitioning methods in which the computational
workload is well balanced and interprocessor communications overheads are
minimized.
Building on initial efforts to improve dynamic load balancing methods for
adaptive unstructured mesh applications, the goal of the proposed research is
to develop fast multicriteria dynamic load balancing methods that are capable
of quickly producing well balanced computations, with well controlled
communications, for a wide variety of applications.

<p>
Users of unstructured meshes may immediately start using our methods via the
APIs and examples in the
<a href="https://github.com/SCOREC/core/">SCOREC/core repository</a>.
Applications without a mesh data structure that are interested in our tools
should <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">contact us</a> via email or a
<a href="https://github.com/SCOREC/EnGPar/issues"> GitHub Issue</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/SCOREC/EnGPar"> EnGPar</a> currently has
initial support for partitioning scale-free graphs via a split-vertex
approach and initial implementation of diffusive procedures on
irregular graphs (i.e. graphs defined by unstructured meshes) has begun.
